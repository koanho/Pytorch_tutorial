You can refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49643225/whats-the-difference-between-reshape-and-view-in-pytorch) StackOverflow answer for more information. In simple terms, contiguous means that the way our data is laid out in the memory is the same as the way we would read elements from it. This happens because some methods, such as `transpose()` and `view()`, do not actually change how our data is stored in the memory. They just change the meta information about out tensor, so that when we use it we will see the elements in the order we expect. \n","\n","* `reshape()` calls `view()` internally if the data is stored contiguously, if not, it returns a copy. The difference here isn't too important for basic tensors, but if you perform operations that make the underlying storage of the data non-contiguous (such as taking a transpose), you will have issues using `view()`. If you would like to match the way your tensor is stored in the memory to how it is used, you can use the `contiguous()` method.

This is where the optomozers comes in. `torch.optim` module contains several optimizers that we can use. Some popular examples are `optim.SGD` and `optim.Adam`. When initializing optimizers, we pass our model parameters, which can be accessed with `model.parameters()`, telling the optimizers which values it will be optimizing. Optimizers also has a learning rate (`lr`) parameter, which determines how big of an update will be made in every step. Different optimizers have different hyperparameters as well."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"W0F-TvV0kk-I"},"source":["import torch.optim as optim"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wgak6o5dlQWF"},"source":["After we have our optimization function, we can define a `loss` that we want to optimize for.
